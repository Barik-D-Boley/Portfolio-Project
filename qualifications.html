When I worked there, we worked under Foremen, and the Foreman that I worked with most was notorious for how hard he worked, and how long his shifts were. Upon his specific request to the owner of the company, I was his goto worker because of how hard I worked, and how rarely I complained.</p>

This was a fun job to have, as I got to be out at Lake Pleasant all day, and I got to talk to a lot of the people that wanted to be out on the lake. This job helped get me a tan (that I lost within a month), and helped build my social skills among those that I would normally not be comfortable with.</p>

In total, there was 111 hours of volunteer hours that we helped add to the Scouting pool of volunteer hours.</p>
